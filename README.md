# Example for Gio.DBusTemplate

This is an example for an implementation for "Gio.DBusTemplate" for PyGObject.

See merge request: -link here-

Run `mpris_demo.py` for an example "music player" that implements MPRIS2 using "Gio.DBusTemplate" 
(it doesn't actually play music).

The implementation of "Gio.DBusTemplate" is in "gdbus_ext.py".
